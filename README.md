<br>
<br>
<p><bold>BitFace</bold> is an simple cryptocurrency ranking for computers and tablet written in JavaScript based on <a href="https://chasing-coins.com/">ChasingCoins API</a> and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap API</a>. You can check top <bold>100</bold> cryptocurrency like <bold>Bitcoin,</bold> <bold>Icon</bold> or <bold>LiteCoin.</bold> <bold>BitFace.</bold> Is a kind of summary of my knowledge - basically, I want to include there knowledge that I've learned about creating a web application. This app is constantly developed by me.</p>
<p>The project was created mainly using <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript ES6</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>.
<br>
<br>
<p>In the future:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add coin to favourite list</li>
  <li>Additional list ICO</li>
  <li>Calculator for coin</li>
  <li>Better performance, quality of app</li>
</ul>

<strike><span style="color:orange;">Unfortunately, but to use this application you must use CORSE bypass, because API's have problems with Access-Control-Allow-Origin.</span>
<h3>If you have already unlocked CORSE before, you do not have to do that!!!</h3>
<br>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://addons.opera.com/pl/extensions/details/cors-toggle/">Opera</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi">Chrome</a><h3 align="center">If you downloaded CORSE plugin for browser, just turn ON this and refresh site :) ! </h3>
